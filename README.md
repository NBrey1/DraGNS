This branch is for calculating DOS of a hexagonal ice (Ice Ih) under Titan temperature (T = 94K) and pressure (P = 1.5 bar) conditions. 

-Directories will include different size cells in the simulations consisting of different number of molecules and atoms
3x3x5 supercell: 300 molecules 1200 atoms
3x3x4 supercell 192 molecules 768 atoms
genice2 342 molecules 1728 atoms (3x3x3)
